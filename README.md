## Project Details

### Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze Airbnb reviews to:
- Understand customer sentiment trends over time
- Identify frequently used keywords and phrases
- Conduct sentiment analysis using the Bing and NRC lexicons
- Investigate the use of diversity and inclusion related language in reviews

### Methodology

1.  **Data Preparation**:
    -   Loaded and cleaned data using R libraries such as `readr`, `dplyr`, and `tidytext`.
    -   Handled missing values and extracted key features like review length and date information.
2.  **Sentiment Analysis**:
    -   Leveraged the Bing and NRC lexicons to identify positive, negative, and emotional words in reviews.
    -   Analyzed the sentiment difference over time and explored top words associated with different emotions.
3.  **Diversity Analysis**:
    -   Searched for keywords related to diversity, inclusion, and accessibility.
    -   Analyzed trends in diversity-related language over time and performed sentiment scoring on these keywords.
4.  **Visualization**:
    -   Created comprehensive visualizations to display trends in review sentiment, diversity language mentions, and emotional associations.

## Results Highlights

-   **Sentiment Trends**: The analysis revealed a general increase in positive sentiment over time, with peaks between 2022 and 2024.
